# DevDraft- Just Another Text Editor

## Introduction 📚

DevDraft is a sophisticated, browser-based text editor application that offers both online and offline functionality. Built to run as a Progressive Web Application (PWA), it provides robust data persistence capabilities, ensuring that your notes and code snippets are saved and retrievable at any time, under any conditions.

## Project Overview 🌐

Our text editor is designed to be a single-page application that satisfies all PWA criteria, ensuring a seamless user experience akin to native applications. It leverages various data persistence techniques, allowing for redundancy to cover scenarios when certain browser features are unavailable.

### Objectives 🎯

- To provide a reliable text editing experience both online and offline.
- To implement data storage with IndexedDB for instant data persistence.
- To bundle a full-stack application deployable via Heroku for universal access.

## Technical Overview 🧩

The PWA-based application utilizes the `idb` package—a lightweight wrapper around the IndexedDB API. The app is bundled with Webpack, features service worker implementation via workbox, and includes a manifest file for PWA capabilities.

## Development Process 💻

### Step 1: IndexedDB Integration

Incorporation of `idb` for immediate database creation and storage upon application start.

### Step 2: Service Worker Activation

Creating a service worker script using Workbox to manage cache and enable offline functionality.

### Step 3: Heroku Deployment

Deploying the application to Heroku with proper build scripts for a webpack-based application.

## Code Breakdown 🧠

### Main Components:

- **Backend**: Node.js and Express.js for server-side logic.
- **Frontend**: React for a dynamic user interface.
- **Data Layer**:  IndexedDB for client-side data persistence.
- **Bundling**: Webpack for module bundling and asset optimization.

## How to Use the Project 🖥️

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Execute `npm run start` from the root directory to start both the backend and serve the client.
4. Access the editor via `localhost:3000` in your web browser.
5. For offline use, install the application by clicking on the 'Install' button.

## Deployment

The application is deployed to Heroku. Please find the live URL and the build scripts included in the project.
